Welcome to the course _Advanced Topics in the Foundations of AI_! (This website is currently still under construction.) It is given during the summer semester 2024 at _LMU Munich_ as part of the _Master in Logic and Philosophy of Science_. 


# Motivation 

In recent years, artificial intelligence and, in particular, machine learning made great---but also disconcerting---progress. However, their foundations are, unlike other areas of computer science, less well understood. This seminar is about the mathematical foundation of AI. After a review of the classical theory (Computability Theory, No-Free-Lunch Theorem, Universal Approximation Theorem, etc.), we read some recent research papers to get an overview of some current approaches to the foundations of AI. The course aims to convey not only the knowledge of these extant approaches, but also the skill to mathematically develop and philosophically assess them.

# General information

The instructor of the seminar is me, [Levin Hornischer](https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/people/faculty/hornischer_levin/index.html). During the semester, we meet on Wednesdays from 12:15 to 13:45 in room 021 (Ludwigstr. 31). Below you find a schedule of when we cover which topic. 

# Reader

You find the latest edition of the reader in this file: [`reader.pdf` (TBA)](). It will be updated as the course progresses.


# Formalities

All the organizational details for the course are described in this file: [`formalities.pdf`](formalities.pdf).
